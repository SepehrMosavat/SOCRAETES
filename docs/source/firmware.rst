SOCRAETES: SOlar Cells Recorded And EmulaTed EaSily
=====================================================

This page provides instructions for compiling and flashing the firmware
on the MCU of SOCRAETES. 
- The current SOCRAETES hardware utilizes a
`Teensy 4.1 <https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html>`_ development board. 
- Compiling and flashing the Teensy board works with the Plugin
`PlatformIO <https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html>`_.
- The recorder is designed to measure the voltage/current curve of a connected solar cell. 
- The measured curve can be either stored on a SD-card or sent to the PC via the USB-connection (serial). 
- For evaluating the data use the python tool provided in `SOCRAETES/software/recorder`

# SOCRAETES: SOlar Cells Recorded And EmulaTed EaSily

## Networked Embedded Systems Group (NES) - Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen

This repository will host SOCRAETES which can be used for
recording various energy harvesting conditions and emulating ("replaying") those
conditions for repeatable and reproducible experimentations and evaluation of
software/hardware designs for energy harvesting devices.

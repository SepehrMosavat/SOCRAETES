## SOCRAETES: SOlar Cells Recorded And EmulaTed EaSily

This document provides instructions for compiling and flashing the firmware
on the MCU of SOCRAETES. The current SOCRAETES hardware utilizes a
[Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html) development board. To
compile and flash the firmware to the Teensy 3.6 board, the following are needed:
1. [Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
2. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
3. [The Arduino Eclipse IDE named Sloeber](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/arduino-eclipse-ide-named-sloeber-product?mpc=true&mpc_state=)
4. [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
5. [Teensy ADC Library](https://github.com/pedvide/ADC)

After installing the mentioned tools, the firmware code can be imported into
Eclipse using the Sloeber plugin, compiled, and flashed to the Teensy 3.6 board.
